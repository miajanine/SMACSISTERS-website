<!----- SMAC PROFILE ----->

			<h1 align="center">DECIDE MODEL</h1><br>
<p>
<b>D- efine the problem</b><br><br>
The problem found is that the SMAC institution is facing finance problems, in turn causing multiple problems. 
This problem needs to be solved, if left alone the SMAC foundation will be led to bankruptcy and the adopted
 children will once again be abandoned<br><br>

<b>E-stablish the criteria </b><br><br>
If the problem were to be solved, We would like to see children be able to get the help they need, like having 
therapy sessions for their trauma, The SMAC sisters are able to pay for their utilities with no worries, and for
 everyone to live a a less stressful life. We would like to fulfill all of these criteria or at the very least
 be able to alleviate their current state to avoid any further problems.<br><br>

<b>C- consider alternatives</b><br><br>
There are three solutions that the team sees most fit for the scenario. First is a business based of vegetable
 and plant growing. The upside to this is that it will still be with the foundation even after we part ways, however,
 it might be a little difficult to find the proper target audience for the product in their area. Second is a Donation
 drive wherein we solicit material and monetary donations from volunteers. The upside to this is that it is easy to get
 people to donate old items and cash but the issue is that it is not a long-term solution and will fall if not give
 n enough initiative. The last is a bake sale, as the name suggests we will be baking goods and selling them for
 a profit which is simple enough to do and can earn alot quickly. The downside to this is, just like the second solution, 
 it isnt necessarily long term and it doesnt make use of resources like the SIP model.<br><br>

<b>I - Identify the best solution</b><br><br>
The best option out of the three mentioned is to create a business that sells plants and vegetables grown from the compost
 made in our SIP. We think this is the best option because it is the most sustainable option that makes use of all of the 
 resources we have available. Moreover, it is a long-term solution that doesnâ€™t leave the foundation even after we part ways
 with the institution. Acknowledging its downside, the difficulty of finding a target audience, we can solve this my using
 social media to market the products that we are trying to sell. <br><br>

<b>D - Develop and implement plan of action</b><br><br>
There are three phases in developing and implementing this plan of action. First is the development stage which includes 
the project proposal drafting, resource evaluation, and business development wherein we prepare and revise all the necessary 
materials for the implementation. Second, is the implementation stage that has two main phases. Phase one is the research
 project wherein we develop the most high quality compost to give to our partner institution. Phase two is the business
 implementation wherein we begin the start-up business of selling plants and vegetables. The last stage is the evaluation stage. <br><br>

<b>E - Evaluate and monitor solution</b><br><br>
The goal of the first phase of SIP is to create a fertilizer that grows a healthy plant with the ideal number of leaves and height.
 This will be reflected in both the final research paper and the final product provided to the foundation for use in their business.
 The amount of income generated by the business is used to measure success during the implementation phase. The number of 
 plants/vegetables sold and the money earned will be tracked and recorded. The amount of school supplies we can buy for the children
 will be used to measure success in the final phase. The amount of school supplies we can buy for the children will be used to
 measure success in the final phase.<br><br>
