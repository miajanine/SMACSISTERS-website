<p id="sip" >Composting is a process where we use our food scraps or organic materials to create a fertilizer to improve the quality of soil.
 Compost acts as a fertilizer because the nutrients from food scraps are beneficial to soil, thus increasing quality. This study focuses on
 how it affects plants, we are interested specifically about how the use of coffee beans or eggshells as a fertilizer affect a Malabar Spinach
 plant (Basella Alba)  compared to without using any compost at all. The reason for our selection of these materials is because of how accessible
 they are. Many simply throw away eggshells and coffee beans because they assume they have already fulfilled their purpose which we see as a missed 
 opportunity. These organic materials contain nutrients that are beneficial for plants and we don’t even need to buy anything. We can just use 
 cracked eggshells and old coffee beans instead of throwing them away to save waste and also help plants.
</p><br>

	<p id="sip" >Our research about the SMAC SISTERS helped us find the problems they are facing. One of the big problems we have discovered is their lack of funding. They aren’t supported by the government and rely on sponsors and favors from friends. Composting can help the community because it can reduce the severity of the problem because it helps save money. Composting is very easy to do, simply you can use food scraps like vegetable shavings, egg shells, maybe even coffee beans instead of throwing them away, and dig it under the soil. It helps increase soil quality, saving you money spent on fertilizer, and even reduces money spent on food because you can create an urban garden for vegetables and fruits. Composting is also helpful for the environment because not only do you prevent food waste, enrich soils, but because of how compost can carry large amounts of water, it helps the plants and the water absorbed can reach places like lakes and replenish it with cleaner water because of its ability to filter it.

	<p id= "Meth">Review of Related Literature</p>
	<p id="sip"> Generally speaking, compost is the recycling of food waste to create a fertilizer for plants in gardening.
	According to an article by Hu(2020), composting improves soil health and reduces soil erosion. Meaning that it is able 
	to increase soil water retention capacity, productivity, resiliency, and even the soils density which means better results 
	for garden plants. In addition to this, elements found in compost such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium have a wide
	number of benefits as well. Nitrogen increases the growth of leaves and gives it a more vibrant green color. Phosphorus 
	influences root growth, the production of seeds, fruits, and flowers. It also is useful in fighting diseases that can 
	affect plants. Lastly, Potassium strengthens the plant's stem and quickens growth. As opposed to non-organic fertilizers 
	that do the same job but with the trade-off of large amounts of synthetic and toxic chemicals. These chemicals, based on 
	Scientific American (2009),  have been known to kill algae and, therefore, start a decomposition process that removes oxygen
	making many bodies of water inhabitable.  Hu(2020) has also reported major benefits when it comes to the environment through 
	cutting off methane and waste. When trash undergoes anaerobic decomposition exclusively in landfills it emits biogas which is
	purely composed of greenhouse gases. However, when that waste is composted, you are not only lessening the amount of garbage 
	in a landfill but also preventing even more biogases from being emitted through the process mentioned earlier. Another report 
	from Eco Gardener(2021) states that 25% of garbage thrown away could be composted and therefore, as stated by (Lights, 2019),
	when composted it reduces landfill waste and emissions. </id>

	The plant we will be focusing on is a Malabar Spinach plant(Basella Alba). This plant is native to tropical Asia, likely
	to be found in India, Indonesia, Sri Lanka and is able to grow in high temperatures, a good alternative if true spinach 
	is in bad quality (Malabar Spinach, Basella Alba, n.d.). Nutrients that are needed for the plant to grow in good quality
	are variations of Phosphorus, Potassium, and Nitrogen(HS1371/HS1371: Florida Cultivation Guide for Malabar Spinach, n.d.),
	This is because these nutrients play a part in developing plants.  Nitrogen helps develop protein by providing amino acids 
	to plants, Phosphorus helps with root growth and helps develop seeds and flowers, and Potassium helps prevent plant diseases
	(How Plants Get Their Nutrients (and What Nutrients Plants Need to Survive), 2019) and is responsible for the movement of 
	nutrients and water in the plant  (Potassium for Crop Production, n.d.). The listed nutrients are the main nutrients that help
	develop plants. They are called macro nutrients and there are also secondary nutrients like Calcium which help create barriers
	against pathogens(Calcium—Nutrient and Messenger, 2019) and Magnesium which helps with the development of chlorophyll, the green
	pigment that helps absorb sunlight(Magnesium for Crop Production, n.d.)</id>
	<br><br>
	<p id="sip">
	There are 4 main types of compost, mainly compost, farmyard manure, green manure, and vermicompost. Compost is composed 
	of just things that have previously been alive or have been excreted by a living organism all mixed together. This looks like
	pet waste, food scraps, and weeds. The second is farmyard manure which is, as its name suggests, made of animal feces which is 
	rich in nutrients such as Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium, as stated by (Admin, 2019). The third is green manure which is
	made up of dead plants that decompost and fertilize the soil. This, according to (Roland Bunch & Echo Staff,1985), releases 
	tons of Nitrogen into the soil that is good for the plants. Finally we have vermicompost, according to (Supply, 2020), this is
	made up of earthworms that encourage germination and water retention.   In order to help grow Basella Alba using however, 
	compost with high amounts of Nitrogen is needed such as fish emulsion, well-rotted manure, coffee grounds, eggshells, or just 
	regular compost. According  to an essay by (NK, 2019), the quality and leaf yield of Basella Alba can be improved by applying 
	90 kg N ha-1 or 120 kg N ha-1 .  This then can be achieved at home by using eggshells that have 0.4 percent of Nitrogen per 2.8 mg. 
	Or coffee grounds that according to (Vanderlinden, 2022) contain 1.45 percent Nitrogen.  We can start off the process by 
	collecting 6 grams of eggshells which is approximately 2 eggshells and 6 grams of coffee beans which is about 47 coffee beans.
	We do not need to worry about the exact number of shells or beans as long as both are worth 6 grams. Then after, it should be
	mixed with 40-60 percent water to keep it moist as advised by (Backyard Scientist, n.d.). Finally pouring each mixture onto 
	the soil of the 2 different sets of the Basella Alba plant for testing. Afterwhich, the nutrients of the eggshells and coffee 
	grounds should be broken down into the soil and absorbed by the roots of the plant. </id>
	<br><br>

	<p id="sip">
	
	Each type of compost has its own specified benefit to the environment or the plant aside from the ones mentioned above.
	Firstly we have regular compost that includes our eggshell fertilizer and coffee ground fertilizer. According to Masterclass
	Staff(2021), eggshells specifically are high in calcium carbonate that aid in the strengthening of the plant's cell walls. 
	In the same article, we are told that this kind of fertilizer also lowers soil acidity, discourages blossom-end rot, controls 
	pests, and encourages root growth. As for coffee grounds, a study by McDonell(2018) revealed that they attract, as we will later 
	discuss, are beneficial for the plant's nutrients. Moving onto farmyard manure that produces increased soil carbon that is an
	important source of energy for plants. This increase is seen in the form of soil microbial biomass C. The controlled amount of
	carbon in the soil is good for the plants because of its role in photosynthesis wherein it is turned into sugar by plants to
	become food. Lastly we can look at vermicompost which is composting with earthworms. According to a new research by (All You Need 
	to Know About Earthworm Castings, n.d.), worm castings, nutrient-filled soil left behind by earthworms, increases water retention,
	soil aeration, and even anchors nutrients into the soil as opposed to it just seeping away with water otherwise.</id>

	<p id="sip">
	When creating compost and using it for gardening we are told by (Cowan, 2019) that its texture should be very loamy and
	crumbly and mulchlike. Now, there are many ways to optimize the use of this compost so that we can effectively and efficiently
	deliver nutrients to plants. One of which is to, stated by (Planet Natural, 2018), mulch it by spreading a thick layer of compost 
	on the soil of your potted plant and letting worms and nature take over. Another way suggested in (T. D. Gardener, 2022) is to
	leave it as a lawn topping by pouring 1 to 3 inches thick layer of it, raking it, and watering it afterwards. Looking back at the
	two most suggested options, we can tell that we do proceed with this project, it is essential that we give a generous amount of 
	compost and make sure that it is integrated into the soil of the plant. This of course is to ensure that the plants get as much
	nutrients as possible. </id>
