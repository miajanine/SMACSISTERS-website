<!----- SMAC PROFILE ----->
<img src = "under.jpg" class = "under">
</div> 
	<section class="SMAC-profile">
			<h1 align="center">SMAC Profile and Data</h1><br>
			<img src ="collage.jpg" alt = "collage" class ="center"> 
			<p align="left" id ="live"> The Sorelle Missionarie dell'Amore di Cristo, Inc (SMAC) is an orphanage founded and run by the nuns
			of the Missionary Sisters of the Love of Christ. Months prior to the founding of the institution in 1998, they observed the poor living conditions of the people in their parish, the children that were abused, alone, and had no-one to turn to. 
			They witnessed the families unable to care for their sick children, let alone provide for their growing needs.
			<br><br>
			  
			  Based on research conducted, we have gathered that the SMAC foundation is in need of a more sustainable source of income. 
Although they have benefactors, volunteers, and even sponsors for each child, it is still a struggle to keep up with all 
the expenses needed for the upkeep of everything in the center. It is seen especially in the data collated from the interview
with SMAC wherein 9 out of the 10 children didn't receive the  psychological assessment as per requested by their professional 
because they were short on money even with discounts available. This is ultimately crucial knowledge because it notifies us 
that this is the specific issue we should be aiming to solve.<br><br> 
 
 We gathered this data through extensive research and background checking of the partner institution. We looked into the various 
 websites published online about the foundation as well as the interview conducted by Ma'am Karen Pido with the head of the
 foundation, Sister Luzviminda Pepito. In these, we could clearly see the foundation's most outstanding problem, lack of funding,
 in more ways than one. Mainly, not being able to pay for facility bills, medical treatment of the kids, and more.<br><br> 
 
 The SMAC Ins. relies heavily on its benefactors and sponsors financially and because of that it causes a decline of how much support 
 the SMAC Ins can give towards the children. Having knowledge of this data is important as we continue our research because it gives 
 us a better understanding of the institution of how we can provide aid and help towards it. It helps us brainstorm ideas on how we can
 support the institution such as creating a promotional facebook page for the institution and donating things such as books, notebooks, 
 pens, and clothes. As the SMAC Ins. heavily relies on benefactors and sponsors, having known of this data can help guide us on what we 
 need to do. <br><br> 
 
 One thing we found interesting about SMAC is how they do everything for these kids, like schooling them, nurturing them, raising them,
 and taking care of them without looking for any profit. Considering how much they work for these kids, it's surprising how they do this 
 all for free. It makes sense, however, as these kids don't have anything that could be used as "payment" for this group. Because of this,
 they've been giving more than they get, and are losing money. This is why we're taking initiative and giving them a branch to make more 
 money to support the children they care for.<br><br> 
 
 We ensured that the data gathered were reliable and valid by checking its sources. Specifically who made, published, and released it
 to the public. In our case, this information was released by the teachers from Ateneo de Davao University Junior High School in 
 collaboration with the SMAC institution making it a credible source of information.<br><br> 
 
 Geometry learning can help me answer my tasks because of how they are taught. In geometry we are given rules and ways to help us
 solve each problem. This can be applied to our tasks because just like in geometry every problem has its own rules and ways to be 
 solved. A student is getting bullied, and the proper way to solve this issue is to tell the prefect. If the student fought back both
 parties would suffer consequences which is the equivalent getting the wrong answer.<br><br> 
 
 As an atenean the data gathering helps me become a better version of myself. I learned to be more responsible, to be able to work 
 together and help those who need it, and feel compassion to others, especially our partner institution. Through our research,
 I have spent countless hours on writing, thinking, and revising answers to properly help the institution, I learned how to compromise 
 for my group mates and help them if they are struggling, and I learned to help others especially if they have a good cause. 
 These actions help me realize how even now I am still developing and improving as a person.<br><br>

<!---PANANAW--->
	<div id = "pananaw">
			<h1 align="center">Pananaw</h1>
			<p align="left">   Ang isyu na gusto namin bigyan ng pansin ay ang kanilang kakulangan ng pundo para sa mga kailangan nila.
			Masasabi namin ito dahil ang aming pananaliksik ginamit katulad sa video tungkol sa SMAC institusyon, sinasabi nila na hindi
			sila suportado ng gobyerno, at umaasa sila sa mga padrino ng bata at sa mga pabor. Ito ay dapat maayos dahil ang ibang 
			problema nila ay kaugnay sa problema naito. Pag maayos ang problema naito, ang ibang isyu nila ay mawala katulad sa 
			kakulangan sa edukasyon at mapaayos rin ang kanilang kalusugang pangkaisipan. <br><br> 
			Swerte kami na di namin nararanasan ang problema hinaharap ng aming institution.  Ngunit meron kaming mga kilala na may 
			 problema na tulad ng mayroon ang  institution. Halimbawa nito ay and aking Tita na nawalan ng trabaho sa panahon ng 
			  pandemya. Napilitan siya na ibenta ang bahay niya upang magkaroon ng pera at mabuhay habang wala pa siyang trabaho. 
			   Tulad ng SMAC, siya ay dumaan ng maraming pagsusubok at kahirapan dahil sa problemang ito. Kaya naman, ang mungkahi 
			   namin para maayos ang suliranin ng institution ay magbibigay kami ng paraan para magkaroon ng mga gulay upang siyang 
			   makain at mabenta. Magagawa namin ito sa pamamagitan ng aming SIP kung saan kami ay nananaliksik ng mga paraan upang
			   maparami at mapaganda ang kalabasan ng ibaâ€™t -ibang gulay at halaman. Ang papel na ito ay maari nilang magamit sa 
			   pagtatanim nila ng mga possibleng produkto. Higit pa rito, konti lamang ang mga tindahan malapit sa institusyon, dahil
			   sa ito satingin namin malakas ang kita nila sa negosyo lalo na dahil mga gulay ang benta.<br><br> 
			   Makatulong ito dahil sila ay maka tipid sa pagbili ng gulay at makakuha rin sila ng kita sa pag benta ng natitirang gulay.
			   Sa panahon na matagumpay ang mungkahi na ito, sila ay makahukuha ng sapat na pondo upang mabili ang mga kakukulangan nila.
			   Hindi na nila kailangan mag-asa sa mga donasyon at pabor ng iba. Kung mamatuloy ito pwede nila mapaunlad ang kanilang 
			   gusali, edukasyon, at ang pamumuhay nila. Mas lalo pa namin ito mapapanindigan kung tutulong kami sa pagsimula ng negosyong
			   ito. Sigurado ako na kung ipapakita namin ang amin umaapaw na suporta sa kanila, ay magtatagumpay at malayo ang mararating
			   nila.  </style>

			<b>Education Facilities Near the Institution</b><br>
				Tugbok Central Elementary School<br>
				Mintal Comprehensive High School <br>
				St. John Paul II College (although this nowhere near the institution we prefer to list it down since we send our Kids here for 
				college education)<br><br><br>
â€‹
				<b>Health Facilities Near the Institution</b><br>
					Alexian Brothers Health & Wellness Center<br>
					St.Therese Clinic of Mintal<br>
					The common illnesses of our kids are cough, allergies, and running nose. Also, they have a low immune system which causes them 
					to infect each other whenever one of them catches a cold.<br><br><br>
					â€‹
					<b>Livelihood-Source of the Institution</b><br>
					We train our Kidson bread making, juice making, baking, and cooking of Filipino snacks or kakanins.<br>
					For the institution, our main source of funds is coming from both local and international funding. However, the sisters-in-charge 
					are always struggling to make ends meet. The pandemic has worsened our conditions because it has crippled the livelihood of most of
					 our sponsors as well. A practical example is our telephone line might be cut off due to missed payment (by July of 2020).<br><br><br>
					â€‹
					<b>Socio-Cultural Information</b><br>
					Mostly our Kids are Bisaya-speaking and Ilonggo (Hiligaynon speakers). Our Kids are also trained to speak the local language,
					 Filipino and English.<br><br><br>
					â€‹
					<b>State of the Environment</b><br>
					We try our best to teach the children how to disposed of the wastes accordingly but often times the children cannot maintain 
					the cleanliness of our home. <br><br><br>
					â€‹
					<b>Peace and Order</b><br>
					So far our home is located in a peaceful place. Although our neighborhood is well known for petty thieves. Mintal Police Station 
					is the nearest authority we can approach. Our Barangay Tanod and Purok Leader help us maintain the peace also.<br><br><br>
					â€‹
					<b>Existing Organizations involved in the Institution</b><br>
					Ateneo de Davao University Junior High School Community - students for their regular program, parents, and faculty.<br><br><br>
					â€‹
					<b>Records of Past Interventions</b><br>
					Repainting of the toys and recreational area, making fence by the AdDU Junior High and Irish students from Ireland.<br><br><br>
